In this section, we will show you some examples of how to use Opel Scanner 1.0 1.71 14 to diagnose and troubleshoot some common issues with Opel cars. We will use a 2010 Opel Astra J as our test car, but you can apply the same steps to other models as well.
 
## Example 1: Check Engine Light On
 
One of the most common problems that drivers face is the check engine light coming on. This indicates that there is a problem with the engine or the emission system. To find out what is causing the light, you need to use Opel Scanner 1.0 1.71 14 to read the fault codes stored in the engine control unit (ECU).
 
To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the USB interface device to your car's OBD port and to your computer.
2. Launch Opel Scanner 1.0 1.71 14 and select your car model or enter the VIN number.
3. Select Engine from the system list and click Connect.
4. Click Read Fault Codes and wait for the software to scan the ECU.
5. You will see a list of fault codes with their descriptions and possible causes. For example, you might see P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1), which means that the air-fuel mixture is too lean and there is not enough fuel in the combustion chamber. This could be caused by a faulty oxygen sensor, a leak in the intake manifold, a clogged fuel filter or injector, or a bad mass air flow sensor.
6. To clear the fault codes and turn off the check engine light, click Clear Fault Codes and confirm your action.
7. If the fault codes come back after clearing them, it means that the problem is not fixed and you need to repair or replace the faulty component.

## Example 2: Airbag Warning Light On
 
Another common problem that drivers face is the airbag warning light coming on. This indicates that there is a problem with the airbag system and it may not deploy in case of an accident. To find out what is causing the light, you need to use Opel Scanner 1.0 1.71 14 to read the fault codes stored in the airbag control unit (ACU).
 
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Connect the USB interface device to your car's OBD port and to your computer.
2. Launch Opel Scanner 1.0 1.71 14 and select your car model or enter the VIN number.
3. Select Airbag from the system list and click Connect.
4. Click Read Fault Codes and wait for the software to scan the ACU.
5. You will see a list of fault codes with their descriptions and possible causes. For example, you might see B1000 - ECU Malfunction, which means that there is a problem with the ACU itself and it needs to be replaced.
6. To clear the fault codes and turn off the airbag warning light, click Clear Fault Codes and confirm your action.
7. If the fault codes come back after clearing them, it means that the problem is not fixed and you need to repair or replace the faulty component.
